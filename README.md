# End-to-end Music Remastering System Using Self-supervised and Adversarial Training


## ABSTRACT
Mastering is an essential step in music production, but it is also a challenging task that has to go through the hands of experienced audio engineers, where they adjust tone, space, and volume of a song. Remastering follows the same technical process, in which the context lies in mastering a song for the times. As these tasks have high entry barriers, we aim to lower the barriers by proposing an end-to-end music remastering system that transforms the mastering style of input audio to that of the target. The system is trained in a self-supervised manner, in which released pop songs were used for training. We also anticipated the model to generate realistic audio reflecting the reference's mastering style by applying a pre-trained encoder and a projection discriminator. We validate our results with quantitative metrics and a subjective listening test and show that the model generated samples of mastering style similar to the target.
